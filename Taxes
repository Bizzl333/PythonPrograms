# Prompt the user for their total income for the year and save the input as a floating-point number.
income = float(input("income"))
# Ask the user if they are married or not and store the answer.
is_married = input("is married")
# If the user is married, ask for the number of years they have been married and save the input as an integer.
years_married = 0
if is_married == "y":
    years_married = int(input("years married"))
# Ask the user for the elevation status of their home address and store the answer as an integer.
elevation = int(input("elevation"))
# If the user lives above sea level, ask for the number of bedrooms in their house and store the answer as an integer.
num_bedrooms = 0
if elevation == 3:
    num_bedrooms = int(input("bedrooms"))


# Calculate the initial income tax based on the total income:
# If income is less than $10,000, tax is 2.3% of income.
if income < 10000:
    tax = (0.023 * income)
# If income is between $10,000 and $50,000, tax is 4.5% of income.
elif 10000 <= income <= 50000:
    tax = (0.045 * income)
# If income is more than $50,000, tax is 6.1% of income.
else:
    tax = (0.061 * income)


# If the user is married, subtract ($1.62 * years_married) from the income tax.
if is_married == "y":
    tax -= (1.62 * years_married)


# Based on the user's elevation status:
# If the user lives below sea level, add $18.32 to the income tax.
if elevation == 1:
    tax += 18.32
# If the user lives at sea level, add 1.6% of income to the income tax.
elif elevation == 2:
    tax += (0.016 * income)
# If the user lives above sea level, add a $5.00 charge per bedroom to the income tax.
else:
    tax += (5 * num_bedrooms)

# Print the final calculated income tax.
print("total", tax)
