# Purpose: calculate the volume of a water tower
import math


# Function to calculate the volume of a sphere
def vol_sphere(radius):
    return (4 / 3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)


# Function to calculate the volume of a cylinder
def vol_cylinder(radius, height):
    return math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height


# Function to calculate the total volume of a water tower
def vol_water_tower(sphere_radius, cylinder_radius, cylinder_height):
    # The water tower consists of cylinder and half sphere
    # Calculate the volume of the cylinder using the vol_cylinder function
    # & the volume of the half sphere by taking half the volume calculated by the vol_sphere function
    total_volume = vol_cylinder(cylinder_radius, cylinder_height) + 0.5 * vol_sphere(sphere_radius)
    return total_volume


# Input
sphere_radius = float(input("What is the radius for the sphere portion: "))
cylinder_radius = float(input("What is the radius for the cylinder portion: "))
cylinder_height = float(input("What is the height for the cylinder portion: "))
# Output
print("Volume: ", vol_water_tower(sphere_radius, cylinder_radius, cylinder_height))
