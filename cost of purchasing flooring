# Purpose: To calculate the cost of purchasing flooring 


#Calculate the amount and cost of floor
#Length, Width, cost per sq ft = user input
#Calculate total square, floor cost, 7% tax and total amount = output

length = float(input("Enter the length of the room in ft: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the room in ft: "))
cost_per_sq_ft = float(input("Enter the cost of the floor per sq. ft: "))

#total sq ft
total_sq_ft = length * width

#total cost of flooring 
cost_of_flooring = total_sq_ft * cost_per_sq_ft

#total tax
tax = 0.07 * cost_of_flooring

#total amount
total_amount = cost_of_flooring + tax

#output
print("Square feet:", total_sq_ft)
print("Flooring:", cost_of_flooring)
print("Tax:", tax)
print("Total:", total_amount)
